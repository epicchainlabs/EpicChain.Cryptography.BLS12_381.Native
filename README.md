## Prerequisites

Before diving into the setup and installation, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- **Rust Programming Language**: You need Rust installed on your system. The recommended version is at least 1.50.0. Rust can be installed via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/), which provides a straightforward installation process.
- **Cargo**: This is Rust's package manager and build system, included with the Rust installation.

## Installation Guide

### 1. Cloning the Repository

To begin, you need to clone the repository to your local machine. This step involves retrieving the source code and setting it up for further use:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/epicchainlabs/EpicChain.Cryptography.BLS12_381.Native.git
cd EpicChain.Cryptography.BLS12_381.Native
```

### 2. Building the Library

With the repository cloned, the next step is to build the library. This process compiles the source code into an executable format:

1. **Navigate to the Cloned Directory**: Ensure you are in the directory where you cloned the repository.
2. **Build the Library Using Cargo**:
    ```sh
    cargo build --release
    ```

   After executing this command, the compiled library will be available in the `target/release` directory. This binary is now ready for integration into your projects.

### 3. Integration

Integrating the library into your project depends on the language you're using. Below are instructions for Rust projects as well as guidance for other languages.

#### Integration with Rust Projects

1. **Add Dependency**: Include `EpicChain.Cryptography.BLS12_381.Native` as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml` file:
    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    epicchain-cryptography-bls12_381-native = { path = "../path_to_your_cloned_repo" }
    ```

2. **Utilize the Library**: Import and use the library in your Rust project:
    ```rust
    extern crate epicchain_cryptography_bls12_381_native;

    use epicchain_cryptography_bls12_381_native::{BLSSecretKey, BLSPublicKey, BLSSignature};

    fn main() {
        // Initialize the library
        epicchain_cryptography_bls12_381_native::init();

        // Generate key pair
        let sk = BLSSecretKey::generate();
        let pk = sk.public_key();

        // Sign a message
        let message = b"Hello, EpicChain!";
        let signature = sk.sign(message);

        // Verify the signature
        let valid = pk.verify(&signature, message);
        if valid {
            println!("Signature is valid.");
        } else {
            println!("Signature is invalid.");
        }
    }
    ```

#### Integration with Other Languages

For projects in other programming languages such as Python or JavaScript, you will need to use Foreign Function Interfaces (FFI) or bindings. This approach allows you to call the native library functions from these languages. Please consult the documentation specific to the FFI or binding methods applicable to your language of choice.

## Usage Examples

### Example: Generating and Verifying BLS Signatures

#### Generating a BLS Signature

Here's a simple Rust example demonstrating how to generate a BLS signature:

```rust
extern crate epicchain_cryptography_bls12_381_native;

use epicchain_cryptography_bls12_381_native::{BLSSecretKey, BLSSignature};

fn main() {
    // Initialize the library
    epicchain_cryptography_bls12_381_native::init();

    // Generate a secret key
    let sk = BLSSecretKey::generate();

    // Message to be signed
    let message = b"Hello, EpicChain!";

    // Generate a signature
    let signature = sk.sign(message);

    println!("Signature: {:?}", signature);
}
```

#### Verifying a BLS Signature

Here's how you can verify a BLS signature using Rust:

```rust
extern crate epicchain_cryptography_bls12_381_native;

use epicchain_cryptography_bls12_381_native::{BLSSecretKey, BLSPublicKey, BLSSignature};

fn main() {
    // Initialize the library
    epicchain_cryptography_bls12_381_native::init();

    // Generate a secret key and corresponding public key
    let sk = BLSSecretKey::generate();
    let pk = sk.public_key();

    // Message to be signed
    let message = b"Hello, EpicChain!";

    // Generate a signature
    let signature = sk.sign(message);

    // Verify the signature
    let valid = pk.verify(&signature, message);
    if valid {
        println!("Signature is valid.");
    } else {
        println!("Signature is invalid.");
    }
}
```
